    "## Part 1: Temperature Conversion\n",
    "Emma and Ashanti recently embarked on a relationship despite living miles apart: Emma resides in the Netherlands, while Ashanti calls Liberia home. Their geographical distance isn't the only challenge they face; they also struggle with the contrasting temperature scales used in their respective countries. In the Netherlands, Celsius is the norm, while Liberia favours Fahrenheit for temperature measurements.\n",
    "To navigate this discrepancy, they began collecting temperature data from their daily routines, drawing from sources like weather reports and recipes.\n",
    "Ashanti, accustomed to Fahrenheit, follows recipes using this scale. However, if Emma wishes to replicate the same dishes, she must convert the temperatures to Celsius since her oven operates on this scale. Emma, on the contrary, often relies on weather reports in Celsius to know how to dress that day. \n",
    "Yet, when she informs Ashanti it is 25 degrees Celsius outside, she is not sure whether she should wear a thick hoodie or if they can wear short pants. \n",
    "Thus, they created a file including some of the temperatures---with their corresponding scales---they want to convert. This file serves as their collaborative tool, aiding them in navigating the nuances of temperature scales and fostering their connection despite the geographical and meteorological disparities they encounter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text file can be found in the `assets` folder and is named `temperature.txt`. The file contains a list of temperature conversion commands.\n",
    "Its format is as follows:\n",
    "* Two lines contain a conversion command, where\n",
    "  * the first line defines the desired conversion. Only two values are possible: `F` and `C`. `F` states that the value should be converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and `C` from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and;\n",
    "  * the second line contains a floating-point number with the temperature in the given scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first four lines of the given file are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "F\n",
    "50\n",
    "C\n",
    "40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, the first two lines indicate that one should convert 50 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. On the other hand, the last two lines request a conversion of 40 degrees Celsius to Farenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are requested to help them with the conversion of such temperatures.\n",
    "Afterward, you should draw a scatter plot to represent the relationship between the two scales for the given data (see Figure 1).\n",
